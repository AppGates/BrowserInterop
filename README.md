# RemiBou.Blazor.BrowserInterop

This library provides C# API for accessing browser API in a Blazor App like windows.console or window.languages. It does not provide any way for manipulating DOM as it can be done easily with Blazor itself. The point it to make those API as close as possible to the browser API and use some nice .net and C# feature when we can.

## API covered
Those are the first API covered, more wil come, please open an issue if you think some API might be valuable.
